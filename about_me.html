			<p>
				I have been passionate about technology since the first time I used a computer. I enjoy learning about 
				new breakthroughs in technology and how it affects the future. I also love problem solving and helping 
				to make other peoples’ lives easier.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently a senior at Carroll University with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Management 
				and Leadership. I have been on the Dean’s List for all of my six semesters attending Carroll 
				and currently have a 3.82/4.00 GPA. My favorite courses are without a doubt my programming courses as 
				I love the challenges that they pose in addition to learning new development techniques.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the years, I have developed strong communication and interpersonal skills. My professional work 
				ethic proves me to be an ambitious individual with a strong attention to detail. I can adapt to changing 
				situations and am comfortable working both on-site or remote. I also have experience in leadership, 
				customer service and event management.

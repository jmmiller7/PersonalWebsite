				The content listed below are things that I&#8217;ve found useful on my quest to becoming a successful software 
				developer.

			<h2>Books</h2>

			<p>
				This book is a wonderful introduction to the world of Android app development! It begins by introducing 
				the developer to the Android OS as well as the components within the IDE. Although this book is based on 
				the use of Eclipse with the Android SDK, it is easy to translate the coverage to Android Studio. This 
				book has an interactive feel to it, in which it walks you through the creation of a fully-functional 
				Android app in each chapter.

			<p>&#8211; If anybody is looking to improve their knowledge on software design patterns, this is the 
			place to look! Instead of the traditional &#8220;text and figure&#8221; textbook, the authors have 
			taken a unique and indirect approach in which they come up with an animation of a scenario, and then apply 
			that scenario to a design pattern.
